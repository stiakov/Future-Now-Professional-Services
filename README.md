# Future Now Professional Services

In this project we are applying our own CSS framework, H'olipolla which was complied with SASS.

## References

We are basing our design from these site templates:

 - [Sonora](https://sonora-demo.squarespace.com/) for hover behavior in navbar and photo setup
 - [Jasper](https://jasper-demo.squarespace.com/) for hover behavior in pictures
 - [Burke](https://burke-demo.squarespace.com/) for general layout styling

## Indications

[Install SASS using this guide](https://sass-lang.com/install)  
Once you are set run this command in the console from the root of this project:  
`sass --watch assets/sass/main-sass.scss:assets/css/style.css`  

Your output file named styles.css will reside on /assets/css.  
You can check or edit all the partials and the main-sass.scss in the /assets/sass/.
